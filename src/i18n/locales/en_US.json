Each year it will involve over 100 major stars of Art, Music, Film, and Literature and it launches to the public on March 30th, 2022. The Listen Campaign rises up through 65 social media and news items, two TV/Streamed series, and two promotions to a global broadcast of a star-studded feature documentary, three days of “Listen Live” from the LA Coliseum streamed globally on June 22nd. The global fundraising broadcast is on June 25th 2022, to 200 countries and includes primetime ABC 8-11 pm in the USA (a rare 3-hour slot, comparable to the Grammys and Oscars).

All subsequent sales of the NFT will incur a 10 percent royalty, with 5 percent funding buybacks of $LSTN to replenish staking rewards for the token community and 5 percent raising funds for The Listen Campaign – the annual surplus of each annual campaign will be distributed to The Listen Charity to support over 75 children’s charity projects around the world.",

As a proof-of-work blockchain, Ethereum often gets heavy congestion and may take 30 mins to hours for a transaction.",

Gas fee is also an advantage of Flow which is around 0.000001 FLOW.

And all the while it also maintains a developer-friendly environment that is also ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant.",
  "Item.faq8.text5": "However, Flow does have its weak points. Flow charges two fees per transaction, the first starting at 0.001 FLOW (~$0.03) to create an account though not a big amount, and the transaction fee, starting at 0.000001 FLOW.
